## Conan "latest" version convention

MSYS2 never adopted semantic versioning, so this package offers a unique versioning option on the packages by using a "conan alias" named "latest". 

[Conan Alias feature Explained](http://conanio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/commands/alias.html?highlight=conan%20alias)

In summary, users can reference the version of "latest" in their requirements as shown in the example below to get the latest release of this package.  "latest" is just an alias which redirects to an actual version of the package with a number. In lieu of a semantic version number, a datestamp will be used as the version number on the concrete Bincrafters packages and the `source()` method of each version of the recipe will use the latest commit on the master branch of the target project, as of that date. 

## For Users: Use this packages

### Basic setup

    $ conan install tap-windows6/latest@bincrafters/stable

### Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conanfile.txt*

    [requires]
    tap-windows6/latest@bincrafters/stable

    [generators]
    txt

Complete the installation of requirements for your project running:

    $ mkdir build && cd build && conan install ..
	
Note: It is recommended that you run conan install from a build directory and not the root of the project directory.  This is because conan generates *conanbuildinfo* files specific to a single build configuration which by default comes from an autodetected default profile located in ~/.conan/profiles/default .  If you pass different build configuration options to conan install, it will generate different *conanbuildinfo* files.  Thus, they should not be added to the root of the project, nor committed to git.
